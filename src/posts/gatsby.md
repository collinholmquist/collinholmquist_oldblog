# Why do this now?

I have always considered myself to more of a consumer than a creator.  Perhaps that's because I feel as if I wouldn't be able to conjure up something as unique, wise or stylish as what I consume.  

For the 7 years I've been a teacher, I've approached my lesson planning the same way. Find content/lesson/activity that I like, tailor it to my students and viola! a lesson that I'm proud of even though I didn't do much to make it.  Regardless of the courses that I taught, I've never gotten out of that rhythm.  That brings me here.  Soem of the best resources, I've found for teaching (& programming) are blog posts.  Ones that intertwine content knowledge with opinions, ones that provide insight rather than just information.  

During my days as a math teacher (so a year ago) math ed blogs were where I went for inspiration.  Bloggers like [Dan Meyer](blog.mrmeyer.com) and [Fawn Nguyen](fawnnguyen.com)
