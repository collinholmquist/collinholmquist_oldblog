## Why do this now?

I have always considered myself to be more of a consumer than a creator.  Perhaps that's because I feel as if I wouldn't be able to conjure up something as unique, wise or stylish as what I consume.  

For the 7 years I've been a teacher, I've approached my lesson planning the same way. Find content/lesson/activity that I like, tailor it to my students and viola! a lesson that I'm proud of even though I didn't do much to make it.  Regardless of the courses that I taught, I've never gotten out of that rhythm. I want to be in that place where I can find a healthy balance between creating original content and reusing the works of others. That brings me here.  Some of the best resources, I've found for teaching (& programming) are blog posts.  More specifically, posts that intertwine content knowledge with opinions, and provide insight over solely information. During my days as a math teacher (so a year ago) math ed blogs were where I went for inspiration.  I have always admired bloggers like [Dan Meyer](https://blog.mrmeyer.com) and Fawn Nguyen for their ability to keep pushing math education forward.  I believe a good chunk of that stems from their ability to reflect upon their experiences (or observations) in the classroom.  

I rarely give myself time to reflect.  Albeit, the life of teacher seldom affords opportunities for reflection unless you intentionally create the space.  I can always convince myself that planning the next lesson is more important than reflecting on a previous one.  I should note that there are two types of reflection I do as a teacher.  One type happens quickly, sometimes in the middle of class, I would say it could also be thought of a responsive teaching ... being responsive what I am seeing and hearing from my students.  A second type of reflection would be outside of the classroom where I would walk through an entire lesson (or any sized chunk of a unit) and give consideration to all aspects of the lesson and be able to know what I need to change moving forward.  This type of reflection is what I desire more of.

## Some personal goals 

#:one: I have always wanted to create my own website but I've never felt like I had the content or drive to do so.  Now, being a computer science teacher has made me reconsider this.  I watch the students be successful at school but also work on personal projects. Why can't I do the same thing!? Granted, I do have a 10-month old and a wife is due with our next any day now.  Those responsibilities obivously take priority.  Yet, there is still an opening of time each day that I get to fill with what I want.  Most days I fill it with browsing social media on my phone and I detest it.  I believe that I can make my freetime more worthwhile & fulfilling.  

#:two: I want my students to see that I value learning alongside my teaching.  Learning does not end when you graduate college.  It's a skill that lasts your lifetime if you let it.  Students are very observant and they detect when you're not passionate about what you are teaching.
