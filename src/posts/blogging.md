## Why do this now?

I have always considered myself to be more of a consumer than a creator.  Perhaps that's because I feel as if I wouldn't be able to conjure up something as unique, wise or stylish as what I consume.  

For the 7 years I've been a teacher, I've approached my lesson planning the same way. Find content/lesson/activity that I like, tailor it to my students and viola! a lesson that I'm proud of even though I didn't do much to make it.  Regardless of the courses that I taught, I've never gotten out of that rhythm. I want to be in that place where I can find a healthy balance between creating original content and reusing the works of others. That brings me here.  Some of the best resources, I've found for teaching (& programming) are blog posts.  More specifically, posts that intertwine content knowledge with opinions, and provide insight over solely information. During my days as a math teacher (so a year ago) math ed blogs were where I went for inspiration.  I have always admired bloggers like [Dan Meyer](https://blog.mrmeyer.com) and Fawn Nguyen for their ability to keep pushing math education forward.  I believe a good chunk of that stems from their ability to reflect upon their experiences (or observations) in the classroom.  

I rarely give myself time to reflect.  Albeit, the life of teacher seldom affords opportunities for reflection unless you intentionally create the space.  I can always convince myself that planning the next lesson is more important than reflecting on a previous one.  I should note that there are two types of reflection I do as a teacher.  One type happens quickly, sometimes in the middle of class, I would say it could also be thought of a responsive teaching ... being responsive what I am seeing and hearing from my students.  A second type of reflection would be outside of the classroom where I would walk through an entire lesson (or any sized chunk of a unit) and give consideration to all aspects of the lesson and be able to know what I need to change moving forward.  This type of reflection is what I desire more of.

## Some personal goals 

#:one: I have always wanted to create my own website but I've never felt like I had the content or drive to do so.  Now, being a computer science teacher has made me reconsider this.  I watch the students be successful at school but also work on personal projects. Why can't I do the same thing!? Granted, I do have a 10-month old and a wife is due with our next any day now.  Those responsibilities obivously take priority.  Yet, there is still an opening of time each day that I get to fill with what I want. I believe that I can make my freetime more worthwhile & fulfilling.  

#:two: I want my students to see that I value learning alongside my teaching.  Learning does not end when you graduate college.  It's a skill that lasts your lifetime if you let it.  Students are keenly aware of when you aren't interested in something or don't find it important. I want them to see that I am interested in the content that I teach. That's a huge motivator for me to put stock in my own learning which enhances my teaching.  Subsequently it makes them more likely to be interested as well, it prompts them to ask themselves: "Why is he so interested in it, so much so that he would devote his free time to pursuing it?".   

#:three: This blog is a great jumping off point to dive deeper into specific concepts.  My goal is to have a mixture of posts about teaching & programming.  I feel a greater level of accoutability in putting something out on the internet for all to see.  There is a duty to ensure that I understand it to be able to communicate that with others.  That doesn't mean I won't have unanswered questions or still be unclear about some details, but I will feel a heightened level of responsibility to ensure my content is well thought-out.  

#:four: I have a space reserved for links to my projects ... which don't exist currently.  But they will! I have many ideas.  

So here it goes! #:raised_hands:
