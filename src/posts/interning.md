title: "Interning...as a teacher"

In April, I was thrilled to find out that I would be interning for 6 weeks in the summer with the developer team at Conagra. Outside the teaching sphere, there are few internship opportunities afforded to teachers that don't involve a focus on, well, teaching. 

Here is what I want to answer in this post: 
- **Why teachers should want to intern**
- **Why businesses should want to have teachers as interns**
- **How the internship should differ from traditional ones**
- **Summarize & highlight my experience at Conagra**

***

Here's what your usual options are for summer break as a teacher: 
1. Do nothing academic or work-related (no #:dollar:) 
2. ***Teach*** summer school
3. ***Teach*** or attend continuing education courses. 
4. Write ***curriculum*** for the district
5. Be a ***grader*** for AP or IB (if you teach those subjects)
6. Take grad ***courses*** 

***

#:question: ***Why should teachers want to intern?***

Referencing the list above, none of those options are wrong or to be looked down upon.  I've done 4/6 and attended some great continuing education classes, taken fantastic grad courses, done a summer's-worth of house projects and travelled to week-long trainings.  All of that to say, the options are contained within the academic sphere of our content focus area and do not venture out into applications. #:eyes: note the words used in the list above. I teach Computer Science, the option available to me to experience the applications of computer science are significantly less than options to attend pedagogical experiences.  However, my understanding of computer science is not (nor should be) contained solely within pedagogy. When I think about the ways I can apply my focus area, the opportunities available to me were mainly in the form of job shadow-esque experiences.  You can job shadow a professional for a couple of hours or maybe day if you're lucky, but it's not immersive nor does it add to your content knowledge.  Additionally, teachers are tasked (and requested) to provide content that is real-world, applicable and useful.  While those are delivered pedagogically, they are all related to content.  Which is why teachers need chances to experience their content area.  We can read all we want about what it's like in the real-world but that has its obvious limitations.  

> #:memo: I should mention that some subject areas don't map well to internship opportunities.
> The skills taught are so broad and are applied is so many settings.

#:question: ***Why should businesses want to hire teachers as interns?***

For my internship, Conagra's goal was not solely to be virtuous; There was a two-fold return on investment.  Frist: I was able to add value to their current projects and work on my own assigned projects.  I did everything that a regualr team member would do.  Thus, they were able to produce more with me there.  Second: Conagra viewed this as a 5-10 year ROI.  There hope (and mine) is that I will be better equiped as a computer science teacher thus leading more students to consider careers in tech.  5-10 years down the road, there would be more available workers to fill the large number of tech job at Conagra & in Omaha.  No doubt that this is a risk. They are taking a risk on me and students choosing to puruse tech careers.  Yet, it's a risk worth taking, especially for a company with that amount of resources and recognition in our community.  Ideally, this program will catch on with other businesses around Omaha and allow for a larger swath of teachers to be involved. That's the goal.  Businesses that help prepare teachers in their content area and in turn have a better prepared workforce.

#:question: ***How should the internship be different than traditional ones?***

Traditionally, interning has (and will continue to be) a way for a company/organization to provide real work experience and feel out if the intern would be a good fit as an employee.  My internship with Conagra was set up so that there would be no recruitment.  One of Conagra's goals was provide to teachers with real-world experience for their classroom; it was not to hire away them away from it.  This is arguably the most important aspect of the experience that makes everything else work as planned.  It also changed the expectations of my manager and myself.  Neither of us had to focus on the potential fit for me as an employee.  We were also able to have conversations about hiring, education and most importantly, me give honest feedback about my experiences.  

For other businesses to do this succesfully, there has to be this promise that teachers will not end up getting taken out of the classroom.  Otherwise, this has the opposite effect.  Taking talented teachers out of the classroom will result in even more brain-drain from Omaha.  Which is one of the primary reasons this internship was developed in the first place.  

Let me be honest: It is difficult to look at my salary as a comp sci teacher compared to other tech positions in Omaha that I believe I be hired for.  Most entry developer jobs will have salary more than I'll ever make as a teacher.  If I'm on the fence about teacher and I get offered a job at Conagra for more than my max salary teaching, it would be very difficult to not pass that opportunity up ... many teachers leave teaching because of this.  The pay isn't competitive.  Thus, the internship needs to be paid and needs to be 8-10 weeks.  If I can add 8K - 10K to my yearly earnings, that could be good enough to keep me as a teacher.
