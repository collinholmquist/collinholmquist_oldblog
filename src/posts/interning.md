title: "Interning...as a teacher"

In April, I was thrilled to find out that I would be interning for 6 weeks in the summer with the developer team at Conagra. I've always   Outside the teaching sphere, there are few internship opportunities afforded to teachers that don't involve a focus on, well, teaching. 

Here is what I want to answer in this post: 


Here's what your usual options are for summer break as a teacher: 
1. Do nothing academic or work-related ( === no #:dollar:) 
2. ***Teach*** summer school
3. ***Teach*** or attend continuing education courses. 
4. Write ***curriculum*** for the district
5. Be a ***grader*** for AP or IB (if you teach those subjects)
6. Take grad ***courses*** 

Now, none of those options are wrong or to be looked down upon.  I've done 4/6.  I have attended some great continuing education classes, taken fantastic grad courses and done a summer's-worth of house projects and travelled to great week-long trainings.  All of that to say, the options are contained within the academic sphere of our content focus area and do not venture out into application.  I teach Computer Science, the option available to me to experience the applications of computer science are significantly less than options to attend pedagogical experiences.  However, my understanding of computer science is not (nor should be) contained solely within pedagogy. When I think about the ways I can apply my focus area, the opportunities available to me were mainly in the form of job-shadow-esque experiences.  You can job shadow a professinal for a couple of hours or maybe day if you're lucky, but it's not immersive nor does it build your content knowledge.  Additionally, we are tasked (and requested) to provide content that is real-world, applicable and useful.  While those are delivered pedagogically, they are all related to content.  Which is why teachers need chances to experience their content area. 

A caveat: 
- Some subject areas don't map well to internship opportunities because the skills taught are so broad (World Languages, English) and are applied is so many settings.  
 
Traditionally, interning has (and will continue to be) a way for a company/organization to provide real work experience to either gain work experience or feel out if the intern would be a good fit as an employee.  Most businesses would find it an inefficient use of resources to hire a teacher as an intern for the summer and not consider them a prospective hire.
