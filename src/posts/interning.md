title: "Interning...as a teacher"

In April, I was thrilled to find out that I would be interning for 6 weeks in the summer with the developer team at Conagra. I've always   Outside the teaching sphere, there are few internship opportunities afforded to teachers that don't involve a focus on, well, teaching. 

Here is what I want to answer in this post: 
- **Why teachers should want to intern**
- **Why businesses should want to have teachers as interns**
- **How the internship should differ from traditional ones**
- **Summarize & highlight my experience at Conagra**

Here's what your usual options are for summer break as a teacher: 
1. Do nothing academic or work-related ( === no #:dollar:) 
2. ***Teach*** summer school
3. ***Teach*** or attend continuing education courses. 
4. Write ***curriculum*** for the district
5. Be a ***grader*** for AP or IB (if you teach those subjects)
6. Take grad ***courses*** 

***

#:question: ***Why should teachers want to intern?***

Referencing the list above, none of those options are wrong or to be looked down upon.  I've done 4/6 and attended some great continuing education classes, taken fantastic grad courses, done a summer's-worth of house projects and travelled to week-long trainings.  All of that to say, the options are contained within the academic sphere of our content focus area and do not venture out into applications. #:eyes: note the words used in the list above. I teach Computer Science, the option available to me to experience the applications of computer science are significantly less than options to attend pedagogical experiences.  However, my understanding of computer science is not (nor should be) contained solely within pedagogy. When I think about the ways I can apply my focus area, the opportunities available to me were mainly in the form of job shadow-esque experiences.  You can job shadow a professional for a couple of hours or maybe day if you're lucky, but it's not immersive nor does it add to your content knowledge.  Additionally, teachers are tasked (and requested) to provide content that is real-world, applicable and useful.  While those are delivered pedagogically, they are all related to content.  Which is why teachers need chances to experience their content area.  We can read all we want about what it's like in the real-world but that has its obvious limitations.  

> #:memo: I should mention that some subject areas don't map well to internship opportunities.
> The skills taught are so broad and are applied is so many settings.

#:question: ***How should the internship be different than traditional ones?***

Traditionally, interning has (and will continue to be) a way for a company/organization to provide real work experience and feel out if the intern would be a good fit as an employee.
